## About me

I'm a doctoral candidate in a dual program in Information and Educational Studies. My research sits within computing education, learning sciences, and youth studies. I regularly work within making and makerspace contexts, aiming to better understand how youth of color work to (re)define, (re)organize, and (re)imagine making and makerspaces, especially as they are used with STEM-oriented learning environments. Through my work, I aim to surface alternative futures for engaging in STEM disciplines that center the desires of the youth and their communities. 

If you'd like to know more about my research, you can check out my [CV here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YbifJyXhfD5EMkdAz3XLy_qsROXJCfbm/view).
